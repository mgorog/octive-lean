# Foundation.Core — the irreducible kernel of the language.

This is the small, total, decidable Core that all surface syntax
eventually compiles into. There is one constructor per fundamental
*meaning*; surface conveniences (`if`/`for`/`while`/matrix literals,
operator overloads, `;`-vs-`,` separators, etc.) are *not* present
here — they live in `Foundation.Surface` and are eliminated by
`Foundation.Compile`.

Design rules:

  1. **Tiny.**  Eight constructors. Anything more belongs in `Surface`.
  2. **Total.**  Every constructor is well-founded by structural
     recursion on its arguments.  No partial pattern matches.
  3. **Effect-free at the AST level.**  `print`/`plot`/`fail` are
     algebraic effects raised at evaluation time (`Foundation.Comp`),
     never tags on the AST.
  4. **Names everywhere.**  Variables, function names, primops all
     resolve through a single environment.  `sin`, `plot`, `+` are
     just identifiers bound in the initial env to primitive functions.
  5. **Sequence is explicit.**  `seq e₁ e₂` discards the value of `e₁`
     and yields the value of `e₂`.  This is what `;`-separation in
     Octave means.  It is *not* a list — recursion on Core is
     structural on the binary tree of `seq` nodes.

/-! Capture-avoiding substitution would go here, but Core's
    semantics is environment-based (see `Foundation.Eval`); we never
    substitute syntactically. The lemma `eval_subst : eval (subst e
    x v) = eval e (env.set x v)` is the proof obligation if we add
    syntactic substitution later.

    A free-variable test `hasFree : String → Core → Bool` also belongs
    here but requires explicit termination because `Core.app` carries
    a `List Core`; we'll add it (with `decreasing_by`) when first
    needed. -/
